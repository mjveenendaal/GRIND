\f0\fs24 \cf0 PROBLEMS:\
\
It\'92s run on the local server, so there has to be a file already uploaded to it before downloading, and I also did not bother getting the external URL, but used the known localhost:8080/ by default;\
\
the \'91delete\'92 button is for selection, which is not yet in use;\
\
dealing with images requires a lot from the <form>, so I put everything under default: the uploaded images are saved under the /frameworkB/media folder; and the downloaded under the  /frameworkB/media/pic folder;\
\
if you download the same image twice, the new picture will be automatically renamed;\
\
in conclusion this version is super unstable and experimental, but I\'92ll see what we can do with other formats i.e. our data.\
\
The download.py is based on the work of Nikhil Haas, therefore I\'92m not uploading it to Github without proper statements\'85}
